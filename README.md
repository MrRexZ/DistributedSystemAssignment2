# Multiplayer Race-Shooter Game
As part of Sunway University's Distributed System module assignment, I am required to create an online game that utilizes Akka framework for server-client communication using the language of Scala. In addition to two of those frameworks, the core main game engine used is Scage.
Inspired by Temple Run, this multiplayer game features procedural generation of levels based on islands where each player are pitted against each other in the same map to reach the objective, located on the top right hand corner of the island. The first player to reach the top right corner is the winner.
Players are also capable of shooting bullet/rocket at each other using left mouse button, to which will cause the player to be pushed in the same direction as the bullet/rocket.
